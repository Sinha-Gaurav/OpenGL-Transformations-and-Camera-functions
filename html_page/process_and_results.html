            Loading Models
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            We used the assimp library to import models stored as .obj files to OpenGL. Three models were made using blender and four models were downloaded from <a href="https://free3d.com/">free3d.com</a>.

            <div style="text-align:left">
                The seven models are:-
                <ol>
                    <li>Car</li>
                    <li>Table</li>
                    <li>Chair</li>
                    <li>Potted plant</li>
                    <li>Teapot with cups</li>
                    <li>Mario character</li>
                    <li>Platform</li>
                </ol>

            Using Transformations
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            We used opengl transformations to relocate the models and create a scene of our choice. Each model was given a color(which was sent to the fragment shader through a uniform) and a transformation matrix which positions the model into its appropriate place in the scene.
            Once the transformation matrices were computed for each model, they are used inside the render loop before each draw call of the model.

            Camera Functions
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            We used the glm library to implement camera functions to move around in our scene using keyboard and mouse as inputs.

            <div style="text-align:left">
                There are 3 main types of camera functions implemented.
                <ol>
                    <li>Pan: Pan helps in moving the camera to different positions and we used the keys W, A, S, D, Q, E for forward, backward, left, right, up and down respectively.</li>
                    <li>Yaw, Pitch and Roll: These are the 3 rotations about v, u and n directions respectively.</li>
                    <li>Zoom: This changes the distance of the center of projection to the front plane aka fov. </li>
                </ol>
